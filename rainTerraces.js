// Instructions:
// Someone sets up a set of unusual elevated terraces. They are all
// the same width, but have varying heights (given as an array). When
// it rains, water gathers in the low terraces that are surrounded by
// taller ones.  Ex: Terraces with heights [3,1,1,4,2] would collect 4
// units of water; two at index 1 and two at index 2.  Water on other
// terraces just runs off the sides.
// Given an array of terrace heights, return the max amount of accumulated water.
